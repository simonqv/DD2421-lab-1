## Assignment 0
MONK-2 is the hardest to learn because it has the most complex `true` condition with the most different cases. This will lead to lost of "questions".

## Assignment 2
A uniform distribution should have a high entropy because there is more uncertainty about the outcome.
A non-uniform distribution should have a lower entropy because the there is less uncertainty about the outcome.

### Examples
- Coin toss: Uniformly distributed (high entropy), either *head* or *tail*. Each side has the same probability of `1/2`.
- Biased coin toss: Non-uniform distribution (low entropy), either *head* or *tail*. But one side is more likely than the other. Lowest entropy is when one side has a probability of 1, which results in entropy of 0.
